Client &amp; Servers assignment

Write a Python script to create a UDP Server and Client using
the Python socket standard library. 
In this scenario, 
1) the client sends a message to the server, and the server replies
with a modified version of the message.
2) The modification task involves doubling every vowel in the
received message before sending it back to the client over the
UDP connection.
Example client execution log:
Enter message to send to server: Hello World!
Received modified message from server: Heelloo Woorld!
Example Server execution log:
Server listening on 127.0.0.1:12345...
Sent modified message back to ('127.0.0.1', 56660): Heelloo Woorld!
